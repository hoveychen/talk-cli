**speak-cli** is a fast, offline-capable multilingual text-to-speech CLI powered by [Kokoro](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx). It auto-detects language, supports 150+ voices, and uses the faster MLX backend automatically on Apple Silicon.

```bash
speak "Hello, world!"
speak "你好，欢迎使用 speak-cli"
speak -v af_sky -s 1.2 "Speed it up a bit"
speak --output hello.wav "Save to file"
```

---

## Features

- **Auto language detection** — switches between English and Chinese based on text content
- **150+ voices** — 54 English voices (American, British, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian) and 103 Chinese voices
- **Apple Silicon optimised** — uses MLX backend for English on M-series Macs, falls back to ONNX automatically
- **Offline after first use** — engine and models are cached in `~/.cache/speak-cli/`
- **Save to file** — export speech as WAV with `--output`
- **Tiny binary** — ~8 MB Go binary; engine and models are downloaded on demand

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Backend |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| macOS | Apple Silicon (arm64) | MLX (fast) + ONNX fallback |
| macOS | Intel (amd64) | ONNX |
| Windows | amd64 | ONNX |
| Linux | — | Export to file only (no audio playback) |

## Usage

### Speak text

```bash
speak "Hello, world!"                        # English (auto-detected)
speak "你好，欢迎使用 speak-cli"               # Chinese (auto-detected)
speak --lang zh "Kokoro is great"            # Force language
speak -v af_sky "Choose a specific voice"    # Choose voice
speak -s 1.5 "Speak 50% faster"             # Adjust speed (0.5–2.0)
speak -o out.wav "Save as WAV"              # Export to file
```

### List voices

```bash
speak voices              # All voices
speak voices --lang en    # English only
speak voices --lang zh    # Chinese only
```

### Pre-download assets (for offline use)

speak init --lang zh      # Chinese only
```

Flags:
      --lang string     Language: auto, en, zh (default "auto")
  -v, --voice string    Voice name (default depends on language)
  -s, --speed float     Speed multiplier 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0)
  -o, --output string   Save WAV to file instead of playing
      --no-progress     Suppress download progress bar
  -h, --help            Help

## How it works

On first use, `speak` downloads the appropriate engine bundle and model:

```
~/.cache/speak-cli/
├── en/
│   ├── engine/     # PyInstaller-packaged Kokoro ONNX or MLX engine
│   └── model/      # model.onnx + voices.bin (~88 MB INT8)
└── zh/
    ├── engine/     # PyInstaller-packaged Kokoro ONNX engine
    └── model/      # model.onnx + voices.bin + config.json (~82 MB INT8)
```

The Go binary manages downloads, invokes the engine subprocess with JSON arguments, and plays back the WAV output. Language auto-detection uses Unicode CJK block (U+4E00–U+9FFF).
